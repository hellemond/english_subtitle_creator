People in Spanish speaking countries 33 00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:11,742 greet each other by shaking hands, but depending on the situation, 34 00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:15,422 we often kiss each other on the cheek. So don't be surprised 35 00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:19,118 if this happens to you. Do you know how we say 36 00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:22,974 thank you in Spanish?
